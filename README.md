This repo contains the source code for Projucer projects created as part of Development of Cross-Platform VSTs (Design Project - CSF371).
The JUCE Tutorials folder contains implementations of tutorials on the JUCE website, bound by the terms of the ISC licence under which JUCE's own code for tutorials is distributed.
The repo also contains copies of the following libraries:
1. wdl-ol (https://github.com/olilarkin/wdl-ol) - Oli Larkin's enhancement of Cockos' iPlug, now no longer maintained
2. iPlug2 (https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2) - The continuation of iPlug/wdl-ol, still a pre-release.
